# VisualFetch

**VisualFetch** is a lightweight JavaScript project that demonstrates frontend-to-backend communication using API calls. It connects a custom Node.js backend to fetch random dinosaur names and integrates with the Unsplash API to retrieve matching dinosaur images.

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand API calls and synchronization between the frontend and backend.

## Features

- Makes API requests from frontend to a local backend (`/dinoname`)
- Calls Unsplash external API to fetch themed images
- Dynamically updates the UI with image and text based on responses
